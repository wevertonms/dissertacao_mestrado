Subsea Pipeline Design, Analysis and Installation is based on the authors' 30 years of experience in offshore. The authors provide rigorous coverage of the entire spectrum of subjects in the discipline, from pipe installation and routing selection and planning to design, construction, and installation of pipelines in some of the harshest underwater environments around the world. All-inclusive, this must-have handbook covers the latest breakthroughs in subjects such as corrosion prevention, pipeline inspection, and welding, while offering an easy-to-understand guide to new design codes currently followed in the United States, United Kingdom, Norway, and other countries. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Inc.

  title = {Assessment {{Of Viv Induced Fatigue In Long Free Spanning Pipelines}}},
  abstract = {Current design practice for free spanning pipelines is to allow free spans as long as the integrity with respect to potential failure modes are checked and found acceptable. The case study for Ormen Lange (OL) pipelines planned in the deep waters of the Norwegian Sea is associated with a large number of very long free spans, which requires significant intervention work if based on the state-of-practice acceptance criteria. The design philosophy of the state-of-the-art design code DNV-RP- F105 "Free Spanning Pipelines" is applied in combination with the experience gained from dedicated OL model tests. Updated project specific design guidelines with multi-mode behavior, typical for OL long free spans, is taken into account and an updated Cross-Flow (CF) response model has been developed. An approach to select the In-Line (IL) mode excited by CF response is suggested. Methods for combining stresses from multiple active modes have been proposed and tested, for both IL and CF Vortex Induced Vibrations (VIV). Fatigue analysis has also been performed on the stress series measured in the model tests and this has been successfully used to verify and validate the presented computational procedure. Uncertainty in the model test based fatigue estimates has been assessed and sensitivity studies have been carried out. Reasons for deviations and potential problem areas for long free spanning pipelines have been identified.},

  abstract = {Vortex induced vibration (VIV) of free spanning pipelines in current is considered. In standard VIV estimation, one mode of oscillation is considered only. Increasing the length of the span, several modal shapes may be excited. Further, due to the sag effect of a long free span, the dynamic properties in vertical and horizontal direction of the span are different. This causes a much more complex VIV response pattern for long free spans than for short spans. The observed VIV response of long free spans during model testing is discussed. Hypotheses that may explain the observed behaviour are presented. Also a format of new design principles for long free spans is outlined.},

  isbn = {978-0-7918-5541-6},
  abstract = {Vortex induced vibration is a major cause of fatigue failure in submarine oil and gas pipelines and steel catenary risers. Even moderate currents can induce vortex shedding, alternately at the top and bottom of the pipeline, at a rate determined by the flow velocity. Each time a vortex sheds, a force is generated in both the in-line and cross-flow direction, causing an oscillatory multi-mode vibration. This vortex induced vibration can give rise to fatigue damage of submarine pipeline spans, especially in the vicinity of the girth welds.},

Geometrical nonlinearity and contact interactions are included in the pipe-laying model and the model is implemented and solved using Abaqus Standard Student Edition. Sensitivity analysis is conducted as range analyses of two pairs of laying parameters while the maximal bending moment in the pipe is observed. Variation of tension force and stinger angle, and the variation of two adjacent rollers' heights is covered. The results of range analyses are presented graphically and discussed. The presented results are useful for any future research on the S-lay pipe-laying, especially for the laying optimization research.},
