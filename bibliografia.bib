On this basis, semi-physical simulation system is built to visualize the initial pipe-laying process. The simulation results are compared with OFFPIPE?s results to verify the mathematical model. The current and wave load effects on the shape and tension of the pipeline and cable are analyzed. This real-time virtual reality system will help engineering project in risk management and prediction as well as staff training, which is of vital significance for minimizing the risk of the actual pipe laying and improving the efficiency of the pipe-laying work.},

    abstract = {Vortex induced vibration is a major cause of fatigue failure in submarine oil and gas pipelines and steel catenary risers. Even moderate currents can induce vortex shedding, alternately at the top and bottom of the pipeline, at a rate determined by the flow velocity. Each time a vortex sheds, a force is generated in both the in-line and cross-flow direction, causing an oscillatory multi-mode vibration. This vortex induced vibration can give rise to fatigue damage of submarine pipeline spans, especially in the vicinity of the girth welds. In this paper, an integrated numerical framework is presented to predict and identify free spans that may be vulnerable to fatigue damage caused by vortex induced vibrations (VIV). An elegant and efficient algorithm is introduced to simulate offshore pipeline installation on an uneven seabed. Once the laydown simulation has been completed, the free spans can be automatically detected. When the fatigue screening for both inline and cross-flow VIV indicates that a particular span may be prone to vortex induced vibrations, a detailed fatigue analysis is required. Amplitude response models are constructed to predict the maximum steady state VIV amplitudes for a given pipeline configuration (mechanical properties) and sea state (hydrodynamic parameters). The vibration amplitudes are translated into corresponding stress ranges, which then provide an input for the fatigue analysis. A case study from the offshore industry is presented, and sensitivity analyses are performed to study the influence of the seabed conditions, where special emphasis is devoted on the selection of pipe soil interaction parameters.},

@article{Ose1999,
    abstract = {This paper presents a Finite Element (FE) model for simulation of the in-situ behavior of offshore pipelines laid on a 3-D seabed, with focus on on-bottom stability. The seabed is produced in the FE model based on 3-D survey data (Digital Terrain Model, DTM) from the area where the pipeline is to be installed. In the in-place analysis part of the model, the load history of laying, flooding, pressure testing, and operation is simulated. In the on-bottom stability analysis part, wave and current loading is applied as a restart of the relevant loading condition and the dynamic behavior of the pipeline is investigated. The importance of simulating the true load history before applying the hydrodynamic loads is that it gives a more correct initial pipe configuration and force distribution prior to the stability analysis. A matter that complicates the on-bottom stability analysis of pipelines on a 3-D seabed is the fact that the hydrodynamic coefficients among other things are dependent on the seabed proximity. This problem has been solved in the FE model by calculating the gaps between the pipe and the seabed at multiple, equally spaced points along the pipe length, and calculating the hydrodynamic coefficients for drag, lift, and added mass as a function of this gap. The developed FE model may be applied to study the global static/dynamic on-bottom behavior of the pipeline, and to evaluate the effects of seabed intervention such as rock dumping and trenching. 3-D FE simulations are presented at the end of the paper as design examples.},

    abstract = {Current design practice for free spanning pipelines is to allow free spans as long as the integrity with respect to potential failure modes are checked and found acceptable. The case study for Ormen Lange (OL) pipelines planned in the deep waters of the Norwegian Sea is associated with a large number of very long free spans, which requires significant intervention work if based on the state-of-practice acceptance criteria. The design philosophy of the state-of-the-art design code DNV-RP- F105 "Free Spanning Pipelines" is applied in combination with the experience gained from dedicated OL model tests. Updated project specific design guidelines with multi-mode behavior, typical for OL long free spans, is taken into account and an updated Cross-Flow (CF) response model has been developed. An approach to select the In-Line (IL) mode excited by CF response is suggested. Methods for combining stresses from multiple active modes have been proposed and tested, for both IL and CF Vortex Induced Vibrations (VIV). Fatigue analysis has also been performed on the stress series measured in the model tests and this has been successfully used to verify and validate the presented computational procedure. Uncertainty in the model test based fatigue estimates has been assessed and sensitivity studies have been carried out. Reasons for deviations and potential problem areas for long free spanning pipelines have been identified.},
