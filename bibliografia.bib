  title = {Assessment {{Of Viv Induced Fatigue In Long Free Spanning Pipelines}}},
  abstract = {Current design practice for free spanning pipelines is to allow free spans as long as the integrity with respect to potential failure modes are checked and found acceptable. The case study for Ormen Lange (OL) pipelines planned in the deep waters of the Norwegian Sea is associated with a large number of very long free spans, which requires significant intervention work if based on the state-of-practice acceptance criteria. The design philosophy of the state-of-the-art design code DNV-RP- F105 "Free Spanning Pipelines" is applied in combination with the experience gained from dedicated OL model tests. Updated project specific design guidelines with multi-mode behavior, typical for OL long free spans, is taken into account and an updated Cross-Flow (CF) response model has been developed. An approach to select the In-Line (IL) mode excited by CF response is suggested. Methods for combining stresses from multiple active modes have been proposed and tested, for both IL and CF Vortex Induced Vibrations (VIV). Fatigue analysis has also been performed on the stress series measured in the model tests and this has been successfully used to verify and validate the presented computational procedure. Uncertainty in the model test based fatigue estimates has been assessed and sensitivity studies have been carried out. Reasons for deviations and potential problem areas for long free spanning pipelines have been identified.},

  abstract = {Vortex induced vibration (VIV) of free spanning pipelines in current is considered. In standard VIV estimation, one mode of oscillation is considered only. Increasing the length of the span, several modal shapes may be excited. Further, due to the sag effect of a long free span, the dynamic properties in vertical and horizontal direction of the span are different. This causes a much more complex VIV response pattern for long free spans than for short spans. The observed VIV response of long free spans during model testing is discussed. Hypotheses that may explain the observed behaviour are presented. Also a format of new design principles for long free spans is outlined.},

  abstract = {Vortex induced vibration is a major cause of fatigue failure in submarine oil and gas pipelines and steel catenary risers. Even moderate currents can induce vortex shedding, alternately at the top and bottom of the pipeline, at a rate determined by the flow velocity. Each time a vortex sheds, a force is generated in both the in-line and cross-flow direction, causing an oscillatory multi-mode vibration. This vortex induced vibration can give rise to fatigue damage of submarine pipeline spans, especially in the vicinity of the girth welds.},

Variation of tension force and stinger angle, and the variation of two adjacent rollers' heights is covered. The results of range analyses are presented graphically and discussed.

  title = {A Finite-Element Model for {{In}}-{{Situ}} Behavior of Offshore Pipelines on Uneven Seabed and Its Application to on-Bottom Stability},
  volume = {II},
  abstract = {This paper presents a Finite Element (FE) model for simulation of the in-situ behavior of offshore pipelines laid on a 3-D seabed, with focus on on-bottom stability. The seabed is produced in the FE model based on 3-D survey data (Digital Terrain Model, DTM) from the area where the pipeline is to be installed. In the in-place analysis part of the model, the load history of laying, flooding, pressure testing, and operation is simulated. In the on-bottom stability analysis part, wave and current loading is applied as a restart of the relevant loading condition and the dynamic behavior of the pipeline is investigated. The importance of simulating the true load history before applying the hydrodynamic loads is that it gives a more correct initial pipe configuration and force distribution prior to the stability analysis. A matter that complicates the on-bottom stability analysis of pipelines on a 3-D seabed is the fact that the hydrodynamic coefficients among other things are dependent on the seabed proximity. This problem has been solved in the FE model by calculating the gaps between the pipe and the seabed at multiple, equally spaced points along the pipe length, and calculating the hydrodynamic coefficients for drag, lift, and added mass as a function of this gap. The developed FE model may be applied to study the global static/dynamic on-bottom behavior of the pipeline, and to evaluate the effects of seabed intervention such as rock dumping and trenching. 3-D FE simulations are presented at the end of the paper as design examples.},

  abstract = {A general assumption in performing vortex-induced vibration (VIV) analysis of pipeline free spans is both ends of the free span are fixed and/or pinned in order to simplify computational simulations; however, DNV Recommended Practice F105 states that these boundary conditions must adequately represent the pipe-soil interaction and the continuality of the pipeline. A computational methodology is developed to determine the effects of pip-soil interaction at the ends of a free span. Three-dimensional fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations are performed by coupling the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes from STAR-CCM+ with the finite element analysis (FEA) codes from ABAQUS. These FSI simulations in combination with separate coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) simulations are modeled to mimic real word conditions by setting up boundary conditions to factor in the effects of pipe-soil interaction at the ends of the span. These simulations show a mitigation of overall stresses to the free spans; as a result, the integration of pipe-soil interaction in free span assessment may prove cost effective in the prevention of unnecessary corrective action.},
